The following **optional** features are implemented:


- [x] Web app implements pseudo-authentication
  - Users can only edit and delete posts or delete comments by entering the secret key, which is set by the user during post creation
  - **or** upon launching the web app, the user is assigned a random user ID. It will be associated with all posts and comments that they make and displayed on them
  - For both options, only the original user author of a post can update or delete it
- [x] Users can repost a previous post by referencing its post ID. On the post page of the new post
  - Users can repost a previous post by referencing its post ID
  - On the post page of the new post, the referenced post is displayed and linked, creating a thread
- [x] Users can customize the interface
  - e.g., selecting the color scheme or showing the content and image of each post on the home feed
- [x] Users can add more characterics to their posts
  - Users can share and view web videos
  - Users can set flags such as "Question" or "Opinion" while creating a post
  - Users can filter posts by flags on the home feed

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

- Post Creation Form: Users can create posts with a required title, optional content, and an external image URL.

- Home Feed with Sorting & Search: Posts are displayed in a feed with sorting options (by creation time or upvotes) and a search bar to filter by title.

- Upvote Button: Each post includes an upvote button that increases the postâ€™s score with every click.

- Post Editing & Deletion: Users can edit or delete their own posts directly from the post detail page.

- Pseudo-Authentication: Each user is assigned a unique ID stored in localStorage, allowing ownership of posts and comments without full login.

- Foreign Key Relationships: Supabase enforces relational integrity between posts and comments for clean data management.

- Responsive Image Handling: External images are resized and styled to maintain layout consistency.

- Error Handling & Feedback: Insert and update operations include error logging and user-friendly messages.

- Modular Component Architecture: Clean separation of concerns with reusable components for posts, comments, forms, and navigation.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Database Schema Alignment Ensuring that frontend field names matched Supabase column names (e.g., title vs tittle) was critical to avoid silent insert failures. This required careful syncing between code and database structure.

- Foreign Key Constraints Setting up a foreign key between comments.post_id and posts.id revealed type mismatches (uuid vs int8). Resolving this involved schema migrations and decisions about using UUIDs for scalability.

- Silent Supabase Errors Supabase operations sometimes failed silently when required fields were missing or mismatched. Adding explicit error logging and feedback helped surface these issues during development.

- Post Creation Not Updating UI After creating a post, the homepage didnâ€™t immediately reflect the new entry due to how Reactâ€™s lifecycle and Supabase fetching were structured. This was resolved by improving navigation and refetch logic.

- Image Display and Layout External image URLs could render oversized visuals that disrupted the layout. Styling adjustments were made to constrain image dimensions and maintain a clean UI.

- Pseudo-Authentication Logic Implementing a lightweight user identity system using localStorage required careful handling to ensure consistent post ownership and comment attribution without full auth.
